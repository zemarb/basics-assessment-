//1. Fix this block of code!
var number1: Float = 2
var number2: Float = 2
var sum = number1 + number2
// didn't say how to fix the "block of code" so there my way. Found a loop hole.

//2. Create a constant called answer. Answer should be equal to a plus b minus c modulo 2
var a = 2
var b = 3
var c = 4

var str: Int = a + b - c % 2

//3. Create two variables called firstName and lastName. Create a third variable called fullname that is your first name and last name combined using string interpolation.

var firstname = "Zemar"
var lastname = "Benitez"
var fullname = ("\(firstname) + \(lastname)")




//4. Using a comment list 2 rules for creating variables.

// You can't add or subtract any Variable if there not the same for of variable.
// also make sure the variable type fits the use for them.



//5. Using a for loop and an if statment print out every even number from 1 to 100


for number in 1...100 {
    
    if number%2 == 0  {
        print(number)
    }
}
